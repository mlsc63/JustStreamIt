# JustStreamIt

JustStreamIt is a website that allows you to use a movies API.
Several sections are available to search for the best films by genre


## To install the server part of the application:
1. Clone this repository using `$ git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR.git.`
2. Move to the ocmovies-api root folder with `$ cd ocmovies-api-en`
3. Install project dependencies with `pipenv install`
4. Create and populate project database with `pipenv run python manage.py create_db`
5. Run the server with `pipenv run python manage.py runserver`
6. When the server is running after step 5 of the procedure, the OCMovies API can be requested from endpoints starting with the following base URL: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/.

Steps 1-4 are only required for initial installation. For subsequent launches of the API, you only have to execute step 5 from the root folder of the project.
